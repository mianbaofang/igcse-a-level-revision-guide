# OxfordAQA Provider Notes

OxfordAQA public pages use this stable pattern:

- `https://www.oxfordaqa.com/subjects/` lists subject category pages.
- Subject pages list both International GCSE and International AS-A-level
  qualification links.
- Subject-page qualification buttons currently expose a useful style signal:
  `btn--type-8` maps to the blue International GCSE listing and `btn--type-7`
  maps to the red International AS-A-level listing. Record this metadata, but
  still verify the qualification type from the title and target page.
- Qualification pages usually contain:
  - `Syllabus summary`
  - `Teaching resources available`
  - `Assessment`
  - `Course specification` with a PDF download link

International GCSE pages should be treated as linear qualifications unless the
source page says otherwise. International AS-A-level pages should be treated as
modular qualifications unless the source page says otherwise.

Include this audience note in generated guides:

OxfordAQA qualifications are built for international students and international
schools following a British curriculum. Specifications commonly state that they
are for teaching and examination outside the United Kingdom. Subject availability
and entry routes can vary by region, school, and exam centre.
