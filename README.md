## Why This Skill Exists

This project began at home. My son is taking his International GCSE exams this
year after moving from a Chinese public-school path into an international
curriculum. In less than a year, the classroom language shifted from Chinese to
English, while the exam clock kept moving.

I used Codex to build a study and revision Skill: take the course requirements,
break knowledge into understandable structures, worked examples, diagrams, and
checkpoints. The goal is not to let AI learn for a child. The goal is to lower
the noise around learning so students can face schoolwork with more calm and
control.

An AI-agent Skill for generating image-rich, printable International GCSE and
International AS-A-level revision handbooks from official exam-board sources.

This version is built around the three exam boards most relevant to mainland
China international-school usage:

| Exam board | Current support |
|---|---|
| AQA | Discovers qualifications from OxfordAQA / Oxford International AQA public pages and reads the public specification PDF. |
| Edexcel | Tries official Pearson Edexcel subject-page candidates from the subject name; falls back to a supplied official subject page or direct specification PDF URL. |
| CAIE | Searches official Cambridge International subject indexes for candidates; falls back to a supplied official subject page or direct syllabus PDF URL; asks for the exam year when several ranges are listed. |

It uses one shared handbook workflow across the three boards: read the official
syllabus, expand it into teachable topic units, create worked examples, decide
which points need visuals, and deliver HTML/PDF output.

## Quick Start

Most users do not need to install Python or run commands. Send this Skill link
to Codex or another Skill-compatible agent:

```text
https://github.com/mianbaofang/igcse-a-level-revision-guide/tree/main/skill
```

Then ask:

```text
Install this Skill, then generate a Chinese AQA Chemistry International GCSE revision handbook and export it as PDF.
```

Typical requests:

```text
Generate an Edexcel Accounting International GCSE revision guide.
Generate a Chinese Cambridge IGCSE Economics guide for the 2027 exam year.
Generate an AQA Mathematics 9260 revision handbook with visual worked examples and final review questions.
```

Before generation starts, the agent should confirm:

1. Exam board, qualification level, subject, code, and official URL when needed.
2. Exam year when the official page lists multiple syllabus ranges.
3. Output language: English or Chinese. Student-facing labels, examples, and
   visual prompts use one language only.
4. Explanation style: formal, friendly, life-scene, story-based, detective, or
   adventure-style.

The user should not be forced to choose an image model at the beginning. The
base handbook is generated first. After that, the agent reports how many complex
infographics are needed. If the user has a callable image API, Skill, script, or
asset directory, those images can be generated or imported later. Otherwise, the
package uses SVG fallback drafts and clearly marks complex visuals for review.

## What It Produces

```text
outputs/chemistry-9202/
  guide.html                 printable student handbook
  guide.pdf                  PDF export
  sections/                  modular guide sections for review
  images/                    SVG drafts, infographic assets, and visual manifest
  run-options.json           confirmed subject, language, and explanation style
  guide-plan.json            topic, example, and revision-task plan
  qualification.json         qualification and source metadata
  validation.json            quality-check report
  handbook-package.json      final delivery manifest
```

The handbook package includes:

- syllabus-based topic structure;
- student-friendly explanations;
- original worked examples with steps and answer checkpoints;
- visual-learning decisions for topics and examples;
- simple SVG diagrams and pending complex-infographic briefs;
- final revision questions;
- printable HTML/PDF output.

## Supported Exam Boards

| Exam board | International GCSE | International AS-A-level | Current behavior |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| AQA | yes | yes | Public catalogue discovery through OxfordAQA / Oxford International AQA pages. |
| Edexcel | yes | yes | Subject-name candidate discovery for common official Pearson Edexcel page patterns; official URL/PDF can override ambiguity. |
| CAIE | yes | yes | Official Cambridge International subject-index candidate discovery; official URL/PDF can override ambiguity; exam year is required for multi-range pages. |
| OCR, WJEC/Eduqas, CCEA, and other UK boards | no | no | Outside the current release scope. |

The current release focuses on AQA, Edexcel, and CAIE. Full official names are
OxfordAQA / Oxford International AQA, Pearson Edexcel, and Cambridge
International. It does not claim support for every UK A-level awarding
organisation.

## Visuals And Writing Styles

A useful handbook cannot be text-only. The workflow has two passes:

1. Build topic explanations and worked examples from the official syllabus.
2. Decide which topics or examples need visual explanation.

Simple reproducible diagrams use SVG. More complex items become visual briefs:
lab apparatus, geometry diagrams, circuits, economics charts, or text-heavy
educational infographics.

When no callable image model is available, chart-like visuals use a scripted
scientific-vector fallback inspired by `nature-figure`: editable SVG with clear
axes, labels, source-bound symbols, and review notes. It is not a substitute for
dense infographics; those remain queued until a reviewed image asset is supplied.

Recommended external image models include:

- OpenAI GPT Image 2.0;
- Qwen Image 2.0 Pro;
- SenseNova U1 Fast.

These are recommendations, not guaranteed built-in capabilities. Users need to
provide their own callable API, Skill, script, or generated image assets. Images
explain selected syllabus points; they must not introduce unsupported exam
claims.

Writing styles include formal exam prep, friendly explanation, life-scene
analogy, story-based teaching, detective reasoning, and adventure-style study
missions. The default is original framing, not copied protected characters or
worlds.

## Language Policy

The output language is chosen before generation:

- English mode keeps student-facing text, labels, examples, and visual prompts in English.
- Chinese mode keeps student-facing text, labels, examples, and visual prompts in Simplified Chinese.
- The generator should not create bilingual `Chinese / English` labels.
- Official English terms can stay in source files or a review appendix, but the student-facing handbook should remain in one language.

## What Changed In v0.2.5

v0.2.5 separates the intro animation by README language. The English README now
shows and links to an English-only animation and GIF preview, while the Chinese
README keeps the Chinese animation and Chinese GIF preview.

## What Changed In v0.2.4

v0.2.4 updates the intro animation copy so it matches the current three-board
support model: AQA catalogue discovery, Edexcel official candidate matching, and
CAIE official subject-index matching with exam-year confirmation.

## What Changed In v0.2.3

v0.2.3 restores the intro-animation preview in the README:

- Added a clickable GIF preview directly under the project-origin story.
- Kept the full HTML animation available on the project site.

## What Changed In v0.2.2

v0.2.2 is a small Skill-quality release after Darwin review:

- Added visible `STOP` / `CHECKPOINT` gates before download, route selection,
  image generation, and final delivery.
- Made Edexcel/CAIE ambiguity handling more explicit: show official candidates
  and wait for the user instead of guessing.
- Documented that AQA has catalogue discovery, while Edexcel and CAIE use
  URL-first / subject-candidate checks rather than full crawlers.
- Clarified that scratch candidate-check outputs are not final handbooks.

## What Changed In v0.2.0

v0.1.0 mainly focused on the AQA handbook-generation path. v0.2.0 turns the
project into a three-exam-board open-source release:

- Added Edexcel official candidate discovery plus official URL/PDF intake.
- Added CAIE official subject-index discovery plus official URL/PDF intake and exam-year selection.
- Strengthened the language lock to avoid half-Chinese, half-English guides.
- Changed image routing: the base handbook is generated first, then complex
  infographic needs are reported.
- Added SVG fallback warnings so drafts are not presented as final complex
  infographics.
- Added cross-subject regression samples to avoid hard-coding one subject's
  structure into all subjects.
- Updated the GitHub README, project page, HTML intro, and sample screenshots
  around the three-board story.

cards, and the minimum source information needed for review.

Families should have subject teachers or syllabus-aware adults review deeper
worked examples before using generated guides as final exam preparation.
