# README Presentation Research Notes

These notes summarize README presentation patterns observed from high-star
GitHub projects. They are not technical architecture references for this
project and are not comparable education or syllabus-generation tools.

Audit date: 2026-06-14. Star counts were checked with the public GitHub API.

## Repositories Checked For README Presentation Only

| Repository | Observed stars during research | README presentation pattern borrowed |
|---|---:|---|
| [open-webui/open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) | 141,366 | Badges, banner image, demo image, key features, install options, docs links |
| [astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | 86,333 | Sharp one-line positioning, fast quick-start path, clean package identity |
| [astral-sh/ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) | 47,960 | Table of contents, installation commands, configuration, contribution links |
| [infiniflow/ragflow](https://github.com/infiniflow/ragflow) | 82,648 | Trust messaging around grounded answers, citations, and reduced hallucinations |
| [matiassingers/awesome-readme](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme) | 21,034 | Recommends images, screenshots, GIFs, text formatting, badges, and navigation |
| [fastapi/fastapi](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) | 99,167 | Strong bilingual/community-friendly docs and production-readiness messaging |

## Design Decisions Applied

Only README and documentation presentation decisions were borrowed:

1. Use a hero image and diagrams instead of a plain text wall.
2. Put a one-sentence project identity at the top.
3. Offer English and Chinese entry points.
4. Show quick start before implementation details.
5. Explain trust and accuracy before advanced generation.
6. Include examples of generated output.
7. Link to deeper docs instead of overloading the README.
8. Keep downloaded PDFs out of source control.

The core architecture, source-traceability model, OxfordAQA provider, parser,
validation gates, and generated guide structure are project-specific.

## Why No AI-generated Raster Hero Yet

The repository currently uses SVG diagrams rather than AI-generated raster
artwork. This keeps the visuals editable, lightweight, and copyright-clean. If a
future branded illustration is needed, route image generation through an
external workflow that the maintainer can actually call, then keep the generated
prompt metadata with the asset.
