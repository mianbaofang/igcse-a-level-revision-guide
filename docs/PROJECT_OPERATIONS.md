# Project Operations Guide / 项目维护说明

Last updated: 2026-06-21

This file is the operational memory for future sessions and agents. Update it
whenever release flow, validation rules, animation assets, repository hygiene, or
Skill usage changes.

## 1. Project Positioning

This repository publishes an AI Skill and Python pipeline for generating
International GCSE and International AS-A-level revision handbooks.

Current public scope:

- AQA, Edexcel, and CAIE are the supported exam-board families.
- AQA supports catalogue discovery through OxfordAQA / Oxford International AQA
  pages.
- Edexcel and CAIE use official candidate matching plus official URL/PDF
  fallback. If the route is ambiguous, return candidates and wait for the user.
- Do not claim support for OCR, WJEC/Eduqas, CCEA, or every UK exam board.
- Do not commit official PDFs, past papers, mark schemes, copied exam questions,
  API keys, local absolute paths, private local notes, or generated output
  folders.

User-facing promise:

1. User gives the Skill link to OpenClaw, Hermes, or another Skill-compatible
   Agent.
2. User asks for a subject revision/study handbook.
3. Agent confirms exam board, subject, required exam year, output language, and
   explanation style.
4. Agent fetches official public syllabus/specification sources.
5. Agent builds topic guides, worked examples, visual briefs, HTML, PDF, and
   validation output.

## 2. Source Of Truth

- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/mianbaofang/igcse-a-level-revision-guide`
- GitHub Pages: `https://mianbaofang.github.io/igcse-a-level-revision-guide/`
- Skill entry: `https://github.com/mianbaofang/igcse-a-level-revision-guide/tree/main/skill`
- Package version: `pyproject.toml` and `src/intl_exam_guide/__init__.py`
- Release history: `CHANGELOG.md` and GitHub Releases
- Public home page: `docs/index.html`
- English/Chinese README: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`

Do not use old local clones or generated outputs as proof of current behavior.
When verifying user experience, start from the GitHub repository or the clean
current working copy.

## 3. Mandatory Update Rule

Every project update must decide whether these files need changes:

- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `README.md`
- `README.zh-CN.md`
- `docs/index.html`
- `docs/PROJECT_OPERATIONS.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
- `skill/SKILL.md`
- `skill/references/revision_guide_spec.md`

If the change affects actual generation behavior, validation, provider support,
CLI options, image routing, release flow, or animation assets, update this file.

Documentation-only wording fixes do not require a package version bump. Any
functional change to Skill behavior, validation, CLI, providers, rendering, or
release assets should bump the patch version.

v0.2.17 added the anti-template language gate. Future wording/tone changes that
affect generated handbook text or validation warnings are functional changes and
should bump the patch version.

v0.2.18 raised the CI coverage gate to 70% and split infographic rendering out
of `rendering/html.py`. Keep parser, renderer, and practice-generator guard
tests updated whenever those areas change.

v0.2.19 fixed a real product-labeling regression: unknown, synthetic, or demo
sources must not fall back to AQA branding. Future provider-label changes need
tests for both explicit AQA detection and neutral unknown-provider output.

v0.2.20 closed the sixth-round audit loop around stale local artifacts and
generator coverage. Release evidence must come from fresh outputs produced by
the current code; ignored `outputs/` folders and old `validation.json` files are
not valid proof. Keep `rendering/icons.py` tracked whenever renderer icon usage
changes.

The seventh-round audit follow-up raised coverage evidence past 80% and added a
fresh offline demo evidence requirement. When preparing the next release, record
the fresh demo/generate command plus the `validation.json` summary in
`CHANGELOG.md` or the GitHub Release notes, but keep the generated `outputs/`
folder ignored and untracked.

v0.2.21 closed the eighth-round testing-coverage gap by adding direct renderer
contract tests for cover identity, stylesheet/print layout, visual manifests,
generated raster reuse, SVG fallback assets, modular handbook packaging, and the
Playwright Chrome-to-Edge PDF fallback route. Future rendering changes should
update these contract tests instead of relying only on end-to-end demo coverage.

v0.2.22 closed the ninth-round rendering coverage gap by adding direct
`rendering/html.py` contract tests for the full HTML entry point, topic-section
renderer, guide cards, diagrams, story-mode blocks, practice cards, visual
example routing, source appendix, assessment fallback, navigation, and topic
title localization. Keep this module covered with direct unit tests whenever
handbook structure changes.

## 4. Version And Release Rules

Use GitHub Releases, not tags alone.

Standard flow for a functional release:

```powershell
python -m pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=70 -q
python -m ruff check .
python -m compileall -q src tests scripts
python scripts/scan_for_raw_keys.py .
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Then:

1. Update `pyproject.toml`.
2. Update `src/intl_exam_guide/__init__.py`.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
4. Update README/project docs if the public promise changed.
5. Commit intentionally.
6. Create an annotated tag, for example `vX.Y.Z`.
7. Push `main`.
8. Push the tag.
9. Create or update the GitHub Release for that tag.

The Release should contain:

- version title;
- what changed;
- validation commands and results;
- usage reminder with the Skill link;
- Source code assets generated by GitHub.

Do not leave a version visible only under `/tags`. The user-facing release page
should be under:

```text
https://github.com/mianbaofang/igcse-a-level-revision-guide/releases
```

## 5. GitHub Release Creation

Preferred method when GitHub CLI is installed:

```powershell
gh release create vX.Y.Z --repo mianbaofang/igcse-a-level-revision-guide --title "vX.Y.Z · short title" --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md --latest
```

If GitHub CLI is unavailable, use the GitHub Releases REST API with the existing
Git credential manager token. Never print or commit the token.

Minimum release payload fields:

- `tag_name`
- `target_commitish`
- `name`
- `body`
- `draft: false`
- `prerelease: false`

If the release already exists, update it instead of creating a duplicate.

## 6. Animation Asset Rules

Animation files:

- Chinese wrapper: `docs/project-intro-animation.html`
- English wrapper: `docs/project-intro-animation-en.html`
- Chinese source: `docs/assets/three-board-support-video/`
- English source: `docs/assets/three-board-support-video-en/`
- README GIF previews:
  - `docs/assets/intro-animation-preview.gif`
  - `docs/assets/intro-animation-preview-en.gif`

Rules:

- Chinese README must show Chinese animation/GIF.
- English README must show English animation/GIF.
- Stage size is `1920x1080`.
- Stage duration is `48` seconds.
- README GIF preview should be 16:9, normally `960x540`.
- HTML animation must autoplay in page, not require opening raw code.
- If animation source text changes, regenerate the relevant preview GIF.
- MP4 export is optional and should not be committed unless a release explicitly
  needs a downloadable video file.

Render command:

```powershell
python scripts/render_intro_animation.py --html docs/project-intro-animation.html --mp4 outputs/project-intro-animation.mp4 --gif docs/assets/intro-animation-preview.gif
python scripts/render_intro_animation.py --html docs/project-intro-animation-en.html --mp4 outputs/project-intro-animation-en.mp4 --gif docs/assets/intro-animation-preview-en.gif
```

For quick README preview refresh, a shorter preview may be rendered, but the
HTML source must still represent the current project.

## 7. Skill And Image Routing Rules

The Skill must not present GPT Image, Qwen Image, or SenseNova as built-in
callable providers.

Current public logic:

- recommended external models: GPT Image 2.0, Qwen Image 2.0 Pro, SenseNova U1
  Fast;
- base generator writes visual briefs and prompt queues;
- real image generation only happens if the user provides a callable route,
  API/script, image-generation Skill, designer workflow, or generated asset
  directory;
- "external" does not mean manual user file-moving. If the route is callable,
  the Agent should run it after the base handbook exists and import or attach
  the reviewed assets automatically;
- SVG is only a fallback for simple diagrams and must carry review warnings when
  used for complex visuals.

Do not show a user-facing menu that implies these models are always available.
Ask for the subject/language/style first. Report complex infographic needs after
the base handbook plan exists.

After changing `skill/`, synchronize any locally installed Skill copy from the
repository's `skill/` directory.

## 8. Validation Rules

Validation must fail on student-facing output that is visibly incomplete.

Important error cases:

- downloaded specification yields too few syllabus topics;
- missing topic guides or practice coverage;
- Chinese placeholder text such as numbered generic syllabus points;
- repeated practice questions under the same topic;
- cross-subject borrowed practice templates;
- missing source URLs or missing specification metadata;
- Edexcel/CAIE ambiguity resolved by guessing instead of returning candidates;
- downloaded official PDFs that only produce generic `Content unit` topics;
- downloaded official PDFs that produce no assessment-paper structure;
- missing manifest files or broken image references.

Important warning cases:

- remaining formulaic AI-style wording in student-facing topic guides or
  practice cards after the anti-template language pass.

PDF export should try Playwright first, then fall back to a local Chrome/Edge
browser. If both routes fail, record a clear PDF export error instead of
masking the rest of the generation run.

Do not treat `issues: []` as meaningful unless the run was generated from the
current code and not copied from old `outputs/` folders.

For visual-output audits, read the three counters together:

- `generated_infographic_assets`: reviewed/generated raster infographic files;
- `svg_fallback_assets`: local SVG fallback files written for draft review;
- `pending_infographic_assets`: complex briefs still waiting for external
  image generation or human review.

A prompt-queue run can legitimately have `generated_infographic_assets: 0` if
SVG fallback assets were written and the warning clearly states that final
complex infographics still need an external model, script, or imported asset.

## 9. Repository Hygiene

Keep committed files focused on source, docs, Skill, tests, screenshots, and
animation assets.

Ignored or local-only artifacts:

- `outputs/`
- `.pytest_cache/`
- `.ruff_cache/`
- `__pycache__/`
- `*.egg-info/`
- downloaded official PDFs;
- generated release sample folders unless explicitly converted into tracked
  screenshots/assets.

Before committing:

```powershell
git clean -fdX -n
python scripts/scan_for_raw_keys.py .
rg -n "local-private-path-pattern" . -S -g "!outputs/**" -g "!.git/**"
```

Run `git clean -fdX` only after reviewing the dry run. Never remove unrelated
user folders or subject-study materials.

## 10. Local Folder Migration Notes

Local project paths may change. Do not write machine-specific absolute paths
into public docs.

When moving the repository:

1. confirm `git status --short` is clean or commit changes first;
2. copy or move the entire repository directory;
3. run `git status --short` in the new location;
4. run a smoke test or at least
   `python -m pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=70 -q`;
5. synchronize the installed Skill copy if `skill/` changed;
6. remove old duplicate clones and ignored outputs after confirming the new
   location works.

The public docs should describe procedure, not a private workstation path.
